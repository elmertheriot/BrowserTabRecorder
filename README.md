# Tab Recorder
Recording your screen on your browser is a pain in the ass. This should make it easier.
Keywords: screen, browser, tab, recording, video, gif, screenshot, process, chrome, extension.

Originally was shooting to add audio to this too, but it turns out there already is a great extension for this called Screencastify! So instead, going to focus on just getting the simple video and GIF creation in there.

Also extended the extension to be able to pull in plugins if other developers would like to add to it. Haven't fully fleshed this out, but thought it'd be an interesting addition.

Hope this is useful to someone out there; would love any help optimizing and improving on it. Feel free to help contribute and expand on this project!
